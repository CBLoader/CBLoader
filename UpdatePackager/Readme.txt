Update Packager 1.2

Put this tool into a folder of parts, and run it.  
It will automatically fill in UpdateInfo, update it if parts have been changed, and copy it to your dropbox.

If you pass it a folder via command-line arguments, it'll use that folder, otherwise it'll default to the one it's in.

First time you run it for a folder, it'll pop up a configuration window.  
Basically, it wants both local and public addresses for your dropbox, and a name for the index.

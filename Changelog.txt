v1.3.0
A new merge process, which will improve your merge times exponentially.
Added two command line arguments: (Issue 64)
 -d Don't download.
 +d Only download [shortcut for Update First + No Launch]
Added <Changelog> element.
Fixed Issue 37: Changed file not being reloaded
Fixed Issue 41: Merge order is strange
Fixed Issue 69: Updater Mechanism does not provide enough information when it fails.
Fixed issue 72: Various issues related to setting a non-default basepath 

v1.2.4.1
"Applying base elements" was popping up when it shouldn't have.
Clarified the secondary merge process.
(Yes, the entirity of this release was to remove one log message, and add a different one, hence why I don't want to bump the version)

v1.2.4
Fixed the Double Custom bug that appears to have shown its face. (Not sure why It's only happening now, the bug itself was has been in there since 1.1)
Added additional default part folder, My Documents\ddi\CBLoader.  
	This is an alternative for people running CB from Program Files\WotC\Character Builder\CharBuilderFull_p, as UAC prevents the Automatic updater.
	The default custom folder is still usable.

v1.2.3
Added a new config option Ignore.
	This allows you to list the parts you want to ignore.
	Ignored Parts will not be downloaded from indexes, and will not be merged if already downloaded.
	Ignored Parts will still be checked for updates and obseletion.

v1.2.2
Fixed a handful of config file bugs:
	CBLoader no longer requires a config file to work. (Issue 40)
	Relative paths in config files didn't work as expected.
	default.config didn't not load if WorkingDirectory is elsewhere, and config file is in CBLoader's directory.
	CBLoader Associations do not work when there is a space in CBLoader's Path. 
		(This affects both config and dnd4e files)
		You must run CBLoader with the -a switch for this fix to take effect.
	New Environmental Variable %CBLOADER% available for your config files. (The directory CBLoader is located in)
Index Files now tell you when they download new files.

v1.2.1
CBloader will now remerge after updating.
Added two new config file options
	UpdateFirst: Tells CBLoader to check for updates before merging.  Enable this if you don't have trouble with the updater.
	LaunchBuilder: Tells CBLoader not to launch the character Builder.  Useful if you needed to HardPatch. (Sorry for forgetting this in 1.1.6)

v1.2
Fixed a handful of minor bugs.
The loader can now chain additional config files using the -c argument.
	You can also launch the config file directly if you update your associations.
The loader can now update parts using the new <UpdateInfo> element.
Added a new file type .index to the loader.  This file provides an index of parts that should be installed.
	It also supports <UpdateInfo>, and can be used to push new parts to users.
Added the <Obsolete> element.  
Added the <MassAppend> element.

v1.1.6
The loader will now merge less frequently. If you are continually modifying a single file, you will notice that only that file will be merged reducing the wait time caused by merging all .parts in previous versions. 

Added Config File support to enable users to bypass the command line. Create a file named default.cbconfig to use it. 
  Note that it does not yet handle every possible command line option.
  Options such as Hard-Patch will probably never exist in config files, for example.
  Refer to  http://cbloadercontentwiki.wikispaces.com/Config+Files for a description

Adjusted the loader such that if a file named cbloader.keyfile exists with cbloader.exe, it will automatically attempt to
use that file as a keyfile without the use of the -k command line option

Deleting a .part file now forces a re-merge

v1.1.5
Fixed Issue 23 - AppendNodes does not work when adding extra rules.

v1.1.4
Added <AppendNodes> and <RemoveNodes> elements.  Refer to http://cbloadercontentwiki.wikispaces.com/Anatomy+of+a+Part for details.
Also fixed a bug related to an incorrectly set Working Directory.

V1.1.3
Added keyfile support. running the application with the -r <fileName> switch will generate a keyfile, running it with 
the -k <filename> switch will force it to use that keyfile. This is useful in allowing users to move the character
builder between machines.

CBLoader now no longer writes files directly to the program files directory. Instead it writes files to the users
application data directory (C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\CBLoader on my machine). This should work around 
several vista/windows 7 UAC issues.

A log file is now created in the application directory. In addition, the window will no longer close if an error is
encountered.

Fixed an issue where having an error, or missing .part file would force a re-merge on every application load. Now
it will only remerge when changed.

Added the -a switch, which will switch the file association for .dnd4e (saved character files) from the standard
character builder to cbloader.exe (Submitted by YeOldSteve)

V1.1.2
Improved the error message when the machine does not have a decryption key
Added 'patch mode', the -p switch can now be used to patch the character builder on-disk in an attempt to bypass issues 
some users are having with the loader solution. Fixed an issue where newlines were being mishandled during the merge 
causing several formatting issues inside character builder.

V1.1.1
Fixed a crash when the 'Custom' folder did not exist'

V1.1.0
Added the ability to use a 'Custom' folder to contain multiple .part files.

V1.0.1
Fixed an issue where the character builder would not load on WindowsXP due to an unhandled breakpoint exception.

v1.0
Initial release

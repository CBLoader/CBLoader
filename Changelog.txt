v1.1.6
Added Config File support.  
  Note that it does not yet handle every possible command line option.
  Options such as Hard-Patch will probably never exist in config files, for example.

v1.1.5
Fixed Issue 23 - AppendNodes does not work when adding extra rules.

v1.1.4
Added <AppendNodes> and <RemoveNodes> elements.  Refer to http://cbloadercontentwiki.wikispaces.com/Anatomy+of+a+Part for details.
Also fixed a bug related to an incorrectly set Working Directory.

V1.1.3
Added keyfile support. running the application with the -r <fileName> switch will generate a keyfile, running it with 
the -k <filename> switch will force it to use that keyfile. This is useful in allowing users to move the character
builder between machines.

CBLoader now no longer writes files directly to the program files directory. Instead it writes files to the users
application data directory (C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\CBLoader on my machine). This should work around 
several vista/windows 7 UAC issues.

A log file is now created in the application directory. In addition, the window will no longer close if an error is
encountered.

Fixed an issue where having an error, or missing .part file would force a re-merge on every application load. Now
it will only remerge when changed.

V1.1.2
Improved the error message when the machine does not have a decryption key
Added 'patch mode', the -p switch can now be used to patch the character builder on-disk in an attempt to bypass issues 
some users are having with the loader solution. Fixed an issue where newlines were being mishandled during the merge 
causing several formatting issues inside character builder.

V1.1.1
Fixed a crash when the 'Custom' folder did not exist'

V1.1.0
Added the ability to use a 'Custom' folder to contain multiple .part files.

V1.0.1
Fixed an issue where the character builder would not load on WindowsXP due to an unhandled breakpoint exception.

v1.0
Initial release

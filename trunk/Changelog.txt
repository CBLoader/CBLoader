v1.2
Fixed a handful of minor bugs.
The loader can now chain additional config files using the -c argument.
	You can also launch the config file directly if you update your associations.
The loader can now update parts using the new <UpdateInfo> element.
Added a new file type .index to the loader.  This file provides an index of parts that should be installed.
	It also supports <UpdateInfo>, and can be used to push new parts to users.
Added the <Obsolete> element.  

v1.1.6
The loader will now merge less frequently. If you are continually modifying a single file, you will notice that only that file will be merged reducing the wait time caused by merging all .parts in previous versions. 

Added Config File support to enable users to bypass the command line. Create a file named default.cbconfig to use it. 
  Note that it does not yet handle every possible command line option.
  Options such as Hard-Patch will probably never exist in config files, for example.
  Refer to  http://cbloadercontentwiki.wikispaces.com/Config+Files for a description

Adjusted the loader such that if a file named cbloader.keyfile exists with cbloader.exe, it will automatically attempt to
use that file as a keyfile without the use of the -k command line option

Deleting a .part file now forces a re-merge

v1.1.5
Fixed Issue 23 - AppendNodes does not work when adding extra rules.

v1.1.4
Added <AppendNodes> and <RemoveNodes> elements.  Refer to http://cbloadercontentwiki.wikispaces.com/Anatomy+of+a+Part for details.
Also fixed a bug related to an incorrectly set Working Directory.

V1.1.3
Added keyfile support. running the application with the -r <fileName> switch will generate a keyfile, running it with 
the -k <filename> switch will force it to use that keyfile. This is useful in allowing users to move the character
builder between machines.

CBLoader now no longer writes files directly to the program files directory. Instead it writes files to the users
application data directory (C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\CBLoader on my machine). This should work around 
several vista/windows 7 UAC issues.

A log file is now created in the application directory. In addition, the window will no longer close if an error is
encountered.

Fixed an issue where having an error, or missing .part file would force a re-merge on every application load. Now
it will only remerge when changed.

Added the -a switch, which will switch the file association for .dnd4e (saved character files) from the standard
character builder to cbloader.exe (Submitted by YeOldSteve)

V1.1.2
Improved the error message when the machine does not have a decryption key
Added 'patch mode', the -p switch can now be used to patch the character builder on-disk in an attempt to bypass issues 
some users are having with the loader solution. Fixed an issue where newlines were being mishandled during the merge 
causing several formatting issues inside character builder.

V1.1.1
Fixed a crash when the 'Custom' folder did not exist'

V1.1.0
Added the ability to use a 'Custom' folder to contain multiple .part files.

V1.0.1
Fixed an issue where the character builder would not load on WindowsXP due to an unhandled breakpoint exception.

v1.0
